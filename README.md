#mth532: differential topology

The homework assignments are from *Differential Topology* by Victor Guillemin
and Alan Pollack, unless the exercise number is prefixed with an `A`.

The `.tex` files live in the main directory; compiled PDFs can be found in
`compiled/`. Additional homework problems can be found in `additional-hw/` and
are the ones referred to by an exercise number prefixed by `A`.

Here are the assignments so far:
